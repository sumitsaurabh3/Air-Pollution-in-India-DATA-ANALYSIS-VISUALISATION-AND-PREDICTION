# Air-Pollution-in-India-DATA-ANALYSIS-VISUALISATION-AND-PREDICTION

The focus of this project is on learning supervised machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (regression), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier (classification). The core objective is to analyze and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) and classify air quality levels as good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, or severe. Using features like SO₂, NO₂, RSPM, and SPM concentrations, the project performs basic data analysis on India Air Quality data, predicts AQI values, and identifies factors influencing air quality. This enhances understanding of regression and classification techniques in real-world applications.
